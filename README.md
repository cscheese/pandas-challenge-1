### Addendum/ Sources & References
Module 4 Activities. Some of this code was created by following along with the course instructor as he demonstrated how to complete the homework by copying and pasting code from course examples and activites.

Resources included: reviewing and going through the class activities and homework, before class tutoring, Xpert Learning Assistant (helpful), some help from ChatGPT 4, but honestly it mostly was not incredibly helpful, I was disappointed that AskBCS Learning was not available - I hope they will have it back soon. Ie even attended a study session with Danielle. I had a tutoring session, too - where I learned a LOT!

All these resources were incredibly helpful.
